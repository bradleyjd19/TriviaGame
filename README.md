# TriviaGame

It's that time again! March brings about one of the most exciting sporting events of the year in the NCAA Basketball Tournament. Brush up on some fun tournament facts with the NCAA March Madness Trivia Game. Click "START" on the main menu to begin. You'll have 20 seconds for each question, just click one of the four answer choices. The correct answer will display, and depending on your selection, will show either a celebratory or a playful, "sad" GIF. If the timer runs out, you'll be shown the correct answer and the game will continue to the next question. Try to get them all correct, and if not, try again! Just click "PLAY AGAIN" on the results screen and you'll start over! Good luck!
